#   Gene Set 1: Genes that are eGenes in cell type X for eQTLs in X OR are proximal (in the 10kb locus) around the eQTLs
# 17:47:03 From deyk to Everyone:
#   Gene Set 2: Gene Set 1 AND expressed in cell type X
# 17:47:19 From deyk to Everyone:
#   Gene Set 3: Gene Set 1 AND specifically expressed in cell type X
# 17:47:36 From deyk to Everyone:
#   Gene Set 4: Gene Set 1 and NOT expressed in cell type X
# 17:47:56 From deyk to Everyone:
#   You want a model that jointly evaluates Gene Set 2, Gene Set 3 and Gene Set 4?
#   17:48:26 From deyk to Everyone:
#   Marginally evaluate Gene Set 2, Gene Set 3 and Gene Set 4
